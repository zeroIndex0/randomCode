I'm messing around with the pixel data of images using javascript.  
One bug that annoys me since I'm unsure as to how I can go about fixing it, is that often times nothing renders.  
I run my render functions with image.onload but that doesnt change the fact that the canvases reamain empty.  
Just something to be aware of.  You will have to hit refresh a few times for this to work.  

This is the output that can be expected:

The image on the far right is my attempt at using the Floyd-Steinberg Dithering algorithm, which can be found on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering)
