I'm messing around with the pixel data of images using javascript.  
This is currently a work in process.  I want to upload it to another machine so ill be storing it here  
for now while it's in its current state.  
If you want to run this, you just have to add an image to the image tag in the index.html file.  
One bug that annoys me since I'm unsure as to how I can go about fixing it, is that often times nothing renders.  
I run my render functions with image.onload but that doesnt change the fact that the canvases reamain empty.  
Just something to be aware of.  You will have to hit refresh a few times for this to work
