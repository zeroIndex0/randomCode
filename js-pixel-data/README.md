I'm messing around with the pixel data of images using javascript.  
One bug that annoys me since I'm unsure as to how I can go about fixing it, is that often times nothing renders.  
I run my render functions with image.onload but that doesnt change the fact that the canvases reamain empty.  
Just something to be aware of.  You will have to hit refresh a few times for this to work.  

This is the output that can be expected:
