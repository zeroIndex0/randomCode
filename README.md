# randomCode
A repository for a collection of progams I've written for the heck of it  
and some snippets that I might want to remember for a later use.  

~~I now have a data structures folder that houses some of the data strutures that I have written~~
  - The data structures have now been moved into their own [repo](https://github.com/zeroIndex0/dataStructures) and will no longer be updated here
